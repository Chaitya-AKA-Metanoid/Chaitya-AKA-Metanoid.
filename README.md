## 🚀 What I'm Working On

My repositories showcase my progress and the "bricks" I'm laying down in my learning journey:

- [`learning-python`](https://github.com/Chaitya-AKA-Metanoid/learning-python):  
  The beginning of my hands-on Python journey. Foundational concepts reinforced through a mini-project to ensure a solid understanding of the basics.

- [`OOPS-learning-in-python-through-projects`](https://github.com/Chaitya-AKA-Metanoid/OOPS-learning-in-python-through-projects):  
  Diving deep into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python:
  - **Game Project:** Applying OOP principles to create an interactive game, demonstrating class design, inheritance, and encapsulation.
  - **Banking System:** Simulating a banking system to showcase real-world use cases for OOP, data handling, and logical flow.

- **Personal Web Project:**  
  Demonstrates the application of my skills in diverse areas, including web development.
